My heart breaks for the victims and all of you are in my thoughts and prayers. I would like to extend my love and condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives and I wish all those injured a speedy and full recovery. I also wish more strength to the hearts and hands of the first responders and the medical personnel who are attending to the injured and to the security personnel who are trying to bring the situation under control. While we struggle to comprehend the depths of depravity people can descend to, and while we all grieve in unison, we need to find the strength to stand together as Sri Lankans; shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. Together we can get through. Divided we have but little hope. Even though our hearts are overwhelmed with emotion, it is vital that we force our minds to be rational and intelligent. Do not rush to judgement or conclusions. Let\u2019s give ourselves time to grieve. Let\u2019s give ourselves the space to try and understand the ground reality.  Loved ones have died. Fellow Sri Lankans have died. Guests visiting our country have died. Do not buy into the spin or conjecture or the conspiracy theories. This is not a game. Eschew the efforts of those who shamefully try to politicise this tragedy.  Let the authorities investigate. Let the authorities bring these cowardly terrorists to justice. For us, our focus should be to love and support those who have been affected. To continue to have compassion and empathy for our neighbours. To keep each other safe. To try and ensure our thoughts, words and deeds enable and empower us to lift each other out of this tragedy. To join together and try our hardest to ensure that no such tragedy can ever occur again.<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sangalefthander\/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Kumar Sangakkara Personal Page<\/a> (@sangalefthander) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-04-21T09:35:01+00:00\">Apr 21, 2019 at 2:35am PDT<\/time><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote> <script async src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script>","date":"2019-04-21 04:54:48","pin":"0","status":"1"},{"title":"","content":"<p>President Donald Trump is offering \"heartfelt condolences\" after the attacks in Sri Lanka but mistakenly says 138 million people have been killed.\u00a0<\/p>","date":"2019-04-21 04:59:17","pin":"0","status":"1"},{"title":"","content":"<p>President Donald Trump offers \"heartfelt condolences\" after the attacks in Sri Lanka but mistakenly says 138 million people have been killed, corrects tweets later.\u00a0<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">138 people have been killed in Sri Lanka, with more that 600 badly injured, in a terrorist attack on churches and hotels.
