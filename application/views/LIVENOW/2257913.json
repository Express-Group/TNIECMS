He noted that &quot;The Finance Minister has proposed a number of strong steps that should revive economic growth. The proposed acceleration of investment in infrastructure, creation of a development finance institution and asset monetization across key sectors are timely. Notable highlights of the Budget include increased investment in capex, recapitalization of public-sector banks, setting up of an asset reconstruction and management company to take over stressed debt, a new securities market code and permitting increased foreign investment in the insurance sector. In fact, the Minister signaled even bolder steps including privatization of two public-sector banks and one insurance company.<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;On the revenue side, the budget appropriately assumes increasing collections through growth and also envisages living with a higher fiscal deficit for the next few years. An aggressive disinvestment plan, and the monetization of land and other governmental assets, if effectively executed will greatly help balance the fiscal equation. This is a preferable approach to increasing taxes at this juncture as enterprises and individuals should instead have the resources to spend and as a result create buoyancy in the economy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&quot;On the tax side, there are important steps taken towards easing compliance and facilitating dispute resolution. While there is no increase in income-tax rates, there is an overhaul of customs rates on some items as well as the introduction of an Agriculture Infrastructure and Development cess on certain items.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n","date":"2021-02-01 15:28:39","pin":"0","status":"1"},{"title":"","content":"<p>We have taken progressive steps for the finance sector.
