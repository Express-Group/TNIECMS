Successive economic surveys have failed to outline India&rsquo;s economic reality and have consequently created a narrative where equity market growth is confused with economic well-being. The latest Survey&rsquo;s reliance on high-frequency data may end up creating even more noise.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n2. We must recognise that India is a low value-adding agriculture dependent economy that faces significant natural as well as economic Uncertainty<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n3. We must envision to build an economy where the business does not need subsidies even for creating low value-adding jobs and the households don&rsquo;t need income support for meeting their basic needs.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n4.&nbsp; From a medium to long-term perspective, we must incentivise Productivity and Value-Creation and discourage Lazy Manufacturing; build the National Innovation System that goes beyond focusing on Global Rankings.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; From short to medium-term perspective, we need enhanced Social Security for rural as well as urban India and tax relief for middle-income families.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n6. Reorient our Resource Mobilisation Strategy to incentivise productive investment and not speculative investment and increase progressiveness in the Indirect Tax Structure<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n7. Uncertainty is the Source of Profit, but it can also cause anxiety and result in stalling an economy, as we have seen in the past. We, therefore, must work with the objective of raising the level of earnings and reducing the volatility of the earnings for households as well as the business.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n8.&nbsp; I would like the finance minister to unequivocally state that the government would play an active role in building India&rsquo;s ability to grow and not be a bystander anymore.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n9. The Indian government must use its status of risk-free borrower to invest and help people build the ability to take risk, as we have no conclusive evidence that deficit-funded public investment is bad.<\/p>\n","date":"2022-02-01 10:55:50","pin":"0","status":"1"},{"title":"Before her speech, Finance Minister had called on President Kovind","content":"<p>FM Sitharaman&nbsp;calls on President&nbsp;Kovind before presenting the Union Budget 2022-23.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/images.newindianexpress.com\/uploads\/user\/ckeditor_images\/article\/2022\/2\/1\/FM.jpg\" width=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><em>(Photo | Twitter\/@rashtrapatibhvn)<\/em><\/p>\n","date":"2022-02-01 11:05:26","pin":"0","status":"1"},{"title":"FM rises to present Union budget 2022","content":"<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/images.newindianexpress.com\/uploads\/user\/ckeditor_images\/article\/2022\/2\/1\/FM1.jpg\" width=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><em>(Photo | Twitter\/@PIB)<\/em><\/p>\n","date":"2022-02-01 11:06:54","pin":"0","status":"1"},{"title":"FM Nirmala Sitharaman talks about pandemic","content":"<p>FM Sitharaman begins the budget presentation by expressing empathy&nbsp;with those who were hit by Covid, health-wise and economically.<\/p>\n","date":"2022-02-01 11:09:27","pin":"0","status":"1"},{"title":"India's economic growth in current fiscal is highest among all large economies: FM","content":"<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Budget seeks to lay a blueprint for the next 25 years, says FM <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/NirmalaSitharaman?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NirmalaSitharaman<\/a>.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/BudgetWithTNIE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BudgetWithTNIE<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Budget2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Budget2022<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TNIEBiz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TNIEBiz<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/RrtsCmFQOw\">pic.twitter.com\/RrtsCmFQOw<\/a><\/p>\n&mdash; The New Indian Express (@NewIndianXpress) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NewIndianXpress\/status\/1488386172275785736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 1, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>","date":"2022-02-01 11:11:25","pin":"0","status":"1"},{"title":"25-year vision  for job creation and privatisation","content":"<p><strong>Sunitha Natti <\/strong>says the Finance Minister has hit the ground running.

The government also expects to play an enabling role in driving growth through private investment. It is indeed possible to achieve the goal of higher, inclusive growth in the long run, as India still is a young country.<\/p>\n\n<p>While productivity was mentioned as a key objective, I would have also liked the government to redefine the Production Linked Incentive Programme to Productivity and Value-creation Linked Incentive Programme. We need to accelerate people and capital productivity and value-creation through innovation at a much faster rate so that we can export to advanced economies. If not, our industry would continue needing the crutches in form of import tariffs.<\/p>\n\n<p>The government has announced an ambitious capital expenditure programme budgeted at Rs 7.50 lakh crore, which is an increase of 24.5% over the revised budget. The change is explained by the increased allocation for Ministry of Road Transport, Department of Telecom and Railways. We have an additional item of nearly Rs 90,000 crores in the form of other grants\/loans\/transfers to states, which in all probability is the additional reform-linked loan that the Finance Minister talked about in her speech. If we exclude that, the increase in the central government expenditure will be about 15%. We would need to ask ourselves, if the government will be able to spend the money allocated for capital expenditure during the current year. As of November, the actual expenditure was only 49.4% of the budget.<\/p>\n\n<p>Staying with the last year, the aggregate revised expenditure is higher by 8.2%, compared to the budgeted expenditure. But after removing the payment for Air India debt and increase in fertilizer and food subsidy of Rs. 160,000 crores, the increase is only 3.6%.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe increase in aggregate budget expenditure for the next year is a miserly 4.6%. I guess that the government is assuming that the economy is back on track, and it does not need its support anymore. The increase in revenue expenditure, other than interest cost, is an even more miserly increase of 0.86%. In effect, the central government expenditure will shrink in real terms. Even if we remove the food subsidy (where we may have some effect of accounting adjustment from the previous years) and interest amounts from our calculations, the increase is still 4.8%, lower than the expected growth in GDP at 11.1%. In other words, the central government&#39;s relative contribution to India&#39;s economy is expected to shrink. All this in a year when the net tax revenue is expected to grow by 9.6%.<\/p>\n\n<p>It seems that the fiscal hawks have had their say. Consequently, we will either end up risking the nascent recovery or the households and MSMEs will have to deal with another year of low depleted savings and indebtedness.<br \/>\nA review of the detailed expenditure for the next year too does not inspire confidence, as the increase in defense, agriculture, and health is 4.6%, 2.5% and 0.8%, respectively. Rural development budget is expected to make do with lower expenditure (-0.30%). Only major sector that is expected to see a large increase (18.5%) in expenditure is Education.<\/p>\n\n<p>If we look at the total transfers to states, the increase is once more 0.52%. Loans of Rs 159,000 crores towards GST compensation are now being replaced by loans state capital expenditure of Rs 100,000 crore. The states&#39; share in taxes has gone up by 9.65%, about the same rate as the increase in the Centre&rsquo;s tax revenue. Since the state governments too have suffered revenue losses (property tax, vehicle registration taxes, etc.), we have a situation once more where the entire burden of driving growth is expected to the shouldered by the private sector &ndash; households, MSMEs and large corporations. Are the households and MSMEs in a position to shoulder the responsibility? I hope so.<\/p>\n","date":"2022-02-01 15:53:16","pin":"1","status":"1"},{"title":"","content":"<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/WATCH?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WATCH<\/a> | FM Nirmala Sitharaman speaks on proposed Digital Rupee &amp; cryptocurrencies: What RBI will issue is a digital currency.
